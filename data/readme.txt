About this dataset:
The dataset includes 80x80pixel images of polystyrene microspheres used to calibrate instruments like flow cytometers or microscopes.

The dataset is comprised of 4 microsphere sizes: 4.5um, 6um, 10um, and 15um microspheres.

For Classification, class labels include both in-focus (if) and out-of-focuse (oof) images of each size, as well as debris and background noise picked up on the digital microscope.
For Regression, the sphere size (in micrometers) is denoted in the 'object_size' column of the 'features' datatables. Debris and background are listed as having 'object_size' = 0.

Sample sizes are as follows: In-Focus - 200 | Out-of-Focus - 100 | Debris/Background - 60
